Prompt: Given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length, 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator, design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height. Assume all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid.  
  
Step 1: Consider the bar in your design to be rigid. Follow these steps to update your portfolio page from HW5:  
a) Create sections to define the problem, your constraints/objectives, and your design degrees of freedom.  
b) Treating the bar as rigid, revisit your submission for HW5 by describing the static analysis you conducted to determine your final design.  
c) Present your final mechanism design in an image or drawing.   

Step 2: The bar in your mechanism is no longer rigid. In fact, it is now best described as a beam which bends due to the combined action of the weight and the actuator force. Consider only the components of these forces transverse to your beam:  
a) Find the maximum deflection in your beam. State your assumptions clearly and describe your analysis.  
b) Choose a beam design (cross-section, material) such that its vertical deflection is below 2% of its length and is the most mass-efficient possible.  
c) Present your final beam design in an image or drawing. 
  
This problem has one degree of freedom.
