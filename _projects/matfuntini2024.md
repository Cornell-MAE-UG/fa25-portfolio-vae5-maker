I worked together with a team six students from Cornell University to pilot the first student WASH project for Engineers in Action. The WASH (water, sanitation, hygiene) system we constructed over the course of 6 weeks consists of a solar powered pump pulling water from a borehole, storage tanks, and a 300 meter distribution system that brings the clean water to taps throughout the school. The system serves about 200 students and staff at Matfuntini Primary School and replaces their previously contaminated and inconsistent water system. The new system aims to reduce water-borne illnesses and improve hygiene practices with the students. The solar powered design of the system is both sustainable and economically viable for continued maintenance. 

As Construction Manager, I created the Gantt chart and Bill of Quantities for the project. On site, I created a daily work plan and led the local community memebers in the construction of their water system. I tracked the inventory of the project and was responsible for ensuring all materials and tools were on site. I had extensive knowledge of the parts and materials needed for the project, and gained hands-on experience with plumbing, power tools, and concrete mixing.
