As a part of the Engineers in Action project team, I worked together with a team of twelve students from Cornell and Duke University. The WASH (water, sanitation, hygiene) system we constructed over the course of 8 weeks consists of a solar powered pump pulling water from a borehole, storage tanks, and a 600 meter distribution system that brings the clean water to taps throughout the school. The system serves about 300 students and staff at Herefords Primary School and replaces their previously contaminated and inconsistent water system. The new system aims to reduce water-borne illnesses and improve hygiene practices with the students. The solar powered design of the system is both sustainable and economically viable for continued maintenance. 

As Project Manager, I led the team through design, documentation including status reports and presentation to professional engineers, EIA staff, and local authority, and manage the team in-country through the construction and cultural interactions. 

The specific design components I worked on were the tapstand and construction drawings. Samples of my work are shown below.

Here is a sample of the technical report writing I completed for one of our deliverables. In addition to writing my sections, I would review the entire document before submitting to professional engineers for review.

Here are some photos of the construction work I did on site:
